# Antialiasing

- Sampling is Ubiquitous in  Computer Graphics
	- Rasterization = Sample 2D Positions  
	- Photograph = Sample Image Sensor Plane
	- Video = Sample Time
- Sampling **Artifacts**  (Errors / Mistakes / Inaccuracies) in  Computer Graphics
	- Jaggies (Staircase Pattern)
	- Moiré Patterns in Imaging
	- Wagon Wheel Illusion (False Motion)
- Behind the Aliasing Artifacts
	- Signals are changing too fast (high frequency),  but sampled too slowly
- Antialiasing Idea:  Blurring (Pre-Filtering) Before Sampling

- **Frequency Domain**
	- Fourier Transform
		- Represent a function as a  weighted sum of sines and cosines
		- Fourier Transform Decomposes A Signal Into Frequencies
		- Higher Frequencies Need Faster Sampling

- Antialiasing
	- How Can We Reduce Aliasing Error?
		- Option 1: Increase sampling rate
			- Essentially increasing the distance between replicas in the Fourier domain
			- Higher resolution displays, sensors, framebuffer
			- But: costly & may need very high resolution
		- Option 2: Antialiasing
			- Making Fourier contents “narrower” before repeating
			- Filtering out high frequencies before sampling
