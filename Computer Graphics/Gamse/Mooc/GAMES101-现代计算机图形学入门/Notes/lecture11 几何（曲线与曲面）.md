Explicit Representations in Computer Graphics

- [[GAMES101_Lecture_11#^c81cvpe8h9s|Point Cloud (Explicit)]]
	- Easiest representation: list of points (x,y,z)
	- Easily represent any kind of geometry
	- Useful for LARGE datasets (>>1 point/pixel)
	- Often converted into polygon mesh
	- Difficult to draw in undersampled regions
- [[GAMES101_Lecture_11#^uosnnyybswl|Polygon Mesh (Explicit)]]
	- Store vertices & polygons (often triangles or quads)
